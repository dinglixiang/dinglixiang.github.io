Recently, my team run the business evolution in weekly. And I wanna share how to do the tasks management in my team.

A little practice is **estimate the daily tasks for every team member**.

1. Seperate the team's weekly goal to team members.
>Begin with the end in mind, and then we will get every key events and key time, like develop completed, test request submitted or design reviewed.

2. Use the cell's background color to mark the task progress.
>
<span style='background-color: green;'>The green is well done</span><br />
<span style='background-color: orange;'>the organge is warning that off tracking</span><br />
<span style="background-color:red;">the red is delayed</span>.

e.g.

<img src="/assets/img/daily_task_report.png"/>
