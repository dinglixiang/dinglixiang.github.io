Sometimes, we should convert the time among the different time zones, such as, what's time in the PST when it's 8 AM in China. [The TIMEBIE](http://www.timebie.com/index.php) is good for you.

e. g.

It's 8 AM in China Time.

At this moment, it's 4 PM on previous day in PST.

The [TIMEBIE](http://www.timebie.com/index.php) tool can help us getting the other time with special time zone, it's perfact.
